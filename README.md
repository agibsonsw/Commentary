Commentary
==========

ST comments (renamed from PrintHtml)

I wanted to rename PrintHtml to Commentary but it seems 
complicated in GitHub. So I created this new repository.

Anyway, this allows the creation and management of comments 
within Sublime Text, and includes an option to output them 
in HTML format.

There's more information within the PrintHtml repo. I will 
move this information here at some point and, eventually, 
might delete the PrintHtml repo.
